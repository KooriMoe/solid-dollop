# Solid-Dollop

A set of rulesets for Apple Services, considering the lamentable network conditions & privacy concerns in mainland China. 
Use the ```Apple-Reject.list``` with caution as it will block the requests from iCloud GCBD (云上贵州). Therefore, think carefully before you apply this rule set to your proxy tools.

## Order of Ruleset

For optimal efficacy, we suggest the following sequence for your proxy tools:
